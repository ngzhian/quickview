Quickview
=========

Watch videos without leaving your YouTube subscriptions feed page.

##What?
![A sreenshot](https://raw.github.com/ngzhian/quickview/master/ss.png)

A div with an embedded iframe shows up when you mouse over the title of the video.

Click outside of the video or press any key to end the video.

##Why?
What's better than a nice subscriptions feed page that you can scroll forever?

A page where you can scroll forever AND watch videos.

##How?
This is a Chrome/Chromium extension, uses jQuery to do some simple attribute extraction,
DOM manipulation, mouse events. Uses iframe to embed video.

To use this, `git clone https://github.com/ngzhian/quickview.git`,
then go to `chrome://extensions` and turn on Developer mode.
Finally just click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and browse
to where you cloned the repository. Hopefully everything works fine!

And you may ask, why is this not in the web store? I just don't think it has a place there, yet.

And it costs $5 :(

##Who?
Hi, people call me Zhi An, but you can call me Tonight,
and I made this because I like to watch YouTube videos and I don't like to click that much.

##Bugs.
This is a weeknight hack, so there are many many many bugs and it looks ugly.
E.g. some videos disable embed and so you can't watch it,
o config options for users, I use used whichever configurations I liked.

I welcome all criticisms and suggestions :)

##License
Probably some CC BY SA, or some BSD, or some GNU kind of license, I really don't know.

Main thing is this is a quick hack and I take not responsibility for exploding browsers.
And of course feel free to fork/hack on this.
